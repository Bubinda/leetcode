# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
 

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height)-1
        max_left, max_right = 0,0
        total_water = 0

        while left < right:
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                if height[left] > max_left:
                    max_left = height[left]
                else:
                    total_water += max_left - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] > max_right:
                    max_right = height[right]
                else:
                    total_water += max_right - height[right]
                right -= 1

        return total_water
