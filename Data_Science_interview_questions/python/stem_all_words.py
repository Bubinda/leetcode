#  Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence, write a function to stem all the words in the sentence with the root forming it.

# In data science, there exists the concept of stemming, which is the heuristic of chopping off the end of a word to clean and bucket it into an easier feature set. Thatâ€™s being tested in this Facebook question.

# One tip: If a word has many roots that can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

# Example:

# Input:


# roots = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
# sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"

# Output:

#  "the cat was rat by the bat"

roots = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"

                shortest = i
